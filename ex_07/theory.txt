Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set1. It works on the condition that while the data in a higher dimensional space is mapped to data in a lower dimension space, the variance of the data in the lower dimensional space should be maximum2.

Here are the steps to perform PCA in R:

Install and load the required packages
Import and prepare your data
Scale your data
Calculate the covariance matrix
Calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues
Choose principal components
Project data onto new feature space
