In this experiment, we prepared a dataset using the PimaIndiansDiabetes data from the mlbench library. We then trained five different models: CART, LDA, SVM, kNN, and Random Forest using the caret library. We used repeated cross-validation with 10 folds and 3 repeats to evaluate the models. After training the models, we collected their resamples and compared their performance using various plots such as box and whisker plots, density plots, dot plots, parallel plots, scatterplots and xyplots. We also calculated the p-values for pair-wise comparisons of the models.
