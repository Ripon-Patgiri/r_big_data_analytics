In this experiment, we explored two types of data transformation techniques: normalization and distribution transformation. Normalization involves scaling a dataset to a fixed range, typically between 0-1. We used two normalization techniques: Min-Max Normalization and Z-Score Normalization. Distribution transformation involves transforming a skewed dataset to a normal distribution. We used three methods for this: Square Root Transformation, Cube Root Transformation, and Log Transformation.
